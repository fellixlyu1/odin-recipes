    <h2>About the Databag API</h2>
    <p>Databag’s API is an open network that provides a decentralized approach for messaging their peers, colleagues, friends, and family members. The API offers the user a way to store their personal data without the concern of data collection and to host group conversations without the intrusion of the user’s privacy.</p>
    <p>The API is written in JavaScript and the responses will be formatted in JSON but by using the Swagger UI, Databag will yield coding samples for several programming languages that are mentioned in this reference guide.</p>
