        <h1><u>Kitchen equipment</u></h1>
        <ul></ul>
            <li>Kitchen twine</li>
            <li>Heavy skillet</li>
            <li>Cooking Brush</li>
            <li>Food processor or blender</li>

        <h1><u>Steps</u></h1>
        <ol></ol>
            <li>Use kitchen twine and tie the tenderloin in four portions.</li>
            <li>Coat your heavy skillet with olive oil over high heat and sear every side of the beef including the ends for two minutes on each side. Season the beef with salt and pepper. Transfer to a plate and brush the mustard over the whole tenderloin.</li>
            <li>Use a food processor to make the duxelles and process the mushrooms, shallots, and thyme.</li>
            <li>Use skillet again and melt butter with medium heat. Add duxelle and evaporate the mixture for 25 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and season according to taste.</li>
            <li>Place plastic wrap that is twice the length and height of the tenderloin on cooking station and rest enough prosciutto to cover the beef. Spread the duxelles evenly and thinly on the prosciutto.</li>
            <li>Season the tenderloin a tad more before placing it on the prosciutto-duxelle coating and wrap the entire beef with the plastic while twisting the log ends and chill it in the fridge.</li>
            <li>Pre-heat the oven at 425 degrees. Spread flour onto your working station and spread the puff pastry while rolling the pastry on the flour, then remove the log out of the plastic wrap and place it on the pastry that is big enough to shape. Prepare an egg wash by beating an egg in the bowl and brush the entire puff pastry with an egg wash.</li>
            <li>Trim the puff pastry and use a fork to make crimp edges. Wrap the pastry with another plastic wrap and chill it in the fridge for 20 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the chilled pastry from the plastic and place it in a baking sheeted tray. Brush the log again with an egg wash and sprinkle with flaky salt.</li>
            <li>Bake the pastry for about 40 to 45 minutes and use a thermometer at the center of the pastry and confirm that the temperature is 120 degrees. Once you take out the pastry, let it rest for 10 minutes.</li>
